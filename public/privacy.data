In using the app, you&rsquo;re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.

Gaminant Entertainment accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android &ndash; the requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you&rsquo;ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Gaminant Entertainment does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
